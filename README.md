Project Overview
This project involves building a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) classifier using the scikit-learn library in Python. The goal is to train a model on a dataset containing information about various transactions throughout the world, with the aim of identifying which transactions are fraudulent and which are genuine. The dataset is provided in the form of a CSV file called "train.csv".

Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

model.py: This file contains the Python code for building the MLP classifier, training it on the training data, making predictions on the test data, and generating a CSV file containing the predictions.

predictions.csv: This file contains the predicted VERDICT for each transaction in the test data, in the form of a CSV file with a single column.

README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and its contents.

Getting Started
To run the model and generate predictions, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required libraries, which include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and any other dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.

Place the train.csv and test.csv files in the same directory as the model.py file.

Run the model.py file using a Python interpreter.

The predictions will be saved in a new file called predictions.csv in the same directory as the model.py file.

Model Details
The MLP classifier is built using the scikit-learn library in Python. The MLPClassifier class is used to create the classifier, with two hidden layers containing 100 and 50 nodes, respectively. The StandardScaler class is used to scale the features to have zero mean and unit variance. The train_test_split function is used to split the training data into a training set and a validation set, with a test size of 20% and a random state of 42. The model is trained on the training set using the fit method, and the accuracy is calculated on the validation set using the score method. Finally, the model is used to make predictions on the test set using the predict method, and the predictions are saved to a CSV file using the to_csv method of the DataFrame class.
